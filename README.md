# JavaThreadTutorial
Java Thread Tutorial from Object Oriented Programming Class
This is a project that was written for an OOP class where we needed to create two contenders to compete for a common goal on separate threads. In this example, I used the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket from SpongeBob to compete to serve 200 guests first. In this project the contenders have varying efficiencies and sleep times, as well as utilize RNG to perform tasks. An attempt was made to balance the contenders.
